Howto: Update from IomegaÂ® Home Media Network Hard Drive, Cloud Edition original firmware:

Warning:

By doing anything that follows, you could:
	Brick your device
	Loose all data on you device
	Void your warranty
or any combination of the above. So don't proceed unless you know what you're doing and you mean it.

Prerequisites:

You will need
	A USB memory stick (alway support other USB disk storage or USB memory card reader) , at least 1GB space on it's first partition (all data on this partition will loose);
	Your device has normal boot from original firmware or other linux system;
	Enabled ssh access to your device;
	A network router with DHCP enabled (it usually is) and the device connected to it (otherwise you won't be able to access the device);
	[option]:Access to the serial console of the device, although not strictly necessary, is helpful because otherwise you'll have no clue what's going on if it doesn't work (more information, but basically what you need is a 3.3V UART-USB adapter);
	[option]:Reasonable knowledge of Linux;

Procedure:

	Power up the device and normal boot up;
	Plug the stick into one of the USB ports of the device;
	Unmount the USB stick and format;
		command: 
			unmount /dev/sdb1 && mkfs.ext3 /dev/sdb1
		or if no need to umount:
			mkfs.ext3 /dev/sdb1
	Download rootfs file(Debian.tgz or ArchLinuxARM.tgz) and upload to your device's /boot directory;
	Mount the USB stick and extract rootfs;
		command:
			mkdir /tmp/usb
			mount /dev/sdb1 /tmp/usb
			cd /boot
			tar -C /tmp/usb -zxf Debian.tgz #[or archlinux: tar -C /tmp/usb -zxvf ArchLinuxARM.tgz]
	Create a sign of bootable system on USB stick and sync;
		command:
			touch /tmp/usb/boot.from.here
			sync
	Write boot sectors data to inner HDD;
		command:
			cd /tmp/usb/boot
			./flushsd.sh /dev/sda
	Copy rootfs file to USB stick;
		command:
			cp /boot/Debian.tgz /tmp/usb/root/Debian.tgz #[or archlinux: cp /boot/ArchLinuxARM.tgz /tmp/usb/root/ArchLinuxARM.tgz]
			sync
	Reboot your device; Don't pull the USB stick from the device, the device will boot up and use the stick's first partition as rootfs;
		command:
			reboot
	When device loading USB stick's first partition as rootfs, both white LEDs on the front blink and red LED turn on;
	After device boot succeed, red LED on the front turn off and white LEDs stop blink(one turn off and one turn on);
	Now, Login your device as root with the password root through SSH client;
	Destroy inner HDD's raid system;
		command:
			lvchange -a n md0_vg
			mdadm --stop --scan
			mdadm --zero-superblock /dev/sda1
	Create new partition table and filesystem on inner HDD(default rootfs partition size:20GB);
		command:
			cd /boot
			./mkgptdisk.sh /dev/sda #[if you want msdos part, command: ./mkdosdisk.sh /dev/sda]
	Mount inner HDD and extract rootfs to it;
		command:
			mkdir /tmp/mydisk
			mount /dev/sda1 /tmp/mydisk
			cd /root
			tar -C /tmp/mydisk -zvxf Debian.tgz #[or archlinux: tar -C /tmp/mydisk -zvxf ArchLinuxARM.tgz]
			sync
	Rewrite boot sectors data to inner HDD;
		command:
			cd /boot
			./flushsd.sh /dev/sda
	Create second partition (user data partition) on inner HDD and format it;
		command:
			parted /dev/sda mkpart primary 21.5GB -1s
			mkfs.ext3 /dev/sda2
	Delete the sign of bootable system on USB stick and reboot;
		command:
			rm /boot.from.here
			sync
			reboot
	Ok, Your device will normal boot to the Debian [or ArchLinuxARM] system and use inner HDD's first partition as rootfs;

Note:
	This Debian [or ArchLinuxARM] system already installed openssh and start the service at bootup, username and password both are root;
	The locale and language setting of this Debian [or ArchLinuxARM] system is chinese, you need reconfigure;
	In this Debian system, apt-get package server in /etc/apt/sources.list used Debian mirror server in china, you can read http://www.debian.org/mirror/list and reconfigure;
	In this Debian [or ArchLinuxARM] systen, HMNHDCE's powerbutton is redefined as:
		Press once: After 8 seconds, system will restart network service;
		Press twice (In 8 seconds, after first press): After 5 seconds, system will reboot;
		Press triple (In 5 seconds, after second press): System will shut down immediately;
		This redefined depend on package screen, it already include in this system;
	You may need regenerate ssh service's key:
		command:
			ssh-keygen -t rsa -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
			ssh-keygen -t dsa -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key
