Howto: Install OpenMediaVault on Debian:

As Squeeze is now out of service you need to update the sources.list to the follow addresses 

Command:
	nano /etc/source.list 
	
Now delete the old addresses or simply put a # before them to comment them out and add these

Insert:
	deb http://archive.debian.org/debian-archive/debian/ squeeze main contrib non-free
	deb-src http://archive.debian.org/debian-archive/debian squeeze main contrib non-free
	deb http://archive.debian.org/debian-security/ squeeze/updates main contrib
	deb-src http://archive.debian.org/debian-security/ squeeze/updates main contrib
	deb http://archive.debian.org/debian-archive/debian-backports squeeze-backports main
	deb http://archive.debian.org/debian-archive/debian-backports squeeze-backports-sloppy main
	
Update your package list
	apt-get update
	apt-get upgrade
	
If you get errors about the keys being out of date or invalid set your date to 2012-01-01

Command:

then re-run apt-get update and upgrade
